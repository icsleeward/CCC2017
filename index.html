				<div class="cols-12 faqs">
					<h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
					<p>A collaborative event that brings people together to create, develop, and hack out ideas they have. Typically the competition is built up of programmers who gather to create a collective program. Normally there is some type of theme that contestants will try to work on, and mini challenges may be provided based on this theme. This is normally a sprint-like event which usually happens over a 48 hour period.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="cols-12">
					<h4>Why are hackathons important?</h4>
					<p>Participants gain soft skills in terms of teamwork, critical thinking, problem solving, and meeting deadlines. These skills are essential in almost all job markets today and it tends to be lacking in many areas of Technology. Students will also get experience in various technologies and methodologies used in today's development environment. Students will have to use critical thinking skills in a compacted time period, which will build their skills in delegating work throughout group members. These events are an excellent place for industry leaders to see what type of talent is available in the community.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="cols-12">
					<h4>What is the challenge with the current model?</h4>
					<p>One of the biggest challenges in this type of model is the various levels of technical ability within the contestants. Most of the competitions are made up of developers who are working in the industry or students who are at advanced levels in their discipline. Another challenge would be that the scheduling of these events arenâ€™t set to cater toward an academic audience. Most competitions fall near examination periods or the mid semester, where the bulk of students assignments are.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="cols-12">
					<h4>What should the event accomplish?</h4>
					<p>Typically developers make plans to complete a project but tend to fall short of their own deadlines. If a certain amount of time is set aside to work on a certain idea or project an individual tends to be more effective and meet their goals faster. This event should give community college students an introduction toward hackathon based events at a level that will encourage a greater amount of students to get involved. Students will build upon their soft skills and gain foundational knowledge of application design.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="cols-12">
					<h4>How is this different from the others?</h4>
					<p>This competition is diverse from other Hackathon models as its key focus is on community college students. Designing the event with students in mind will make it more attractive to these talented and skilled individuals. Planning the event at a date that will allow more students to dedicate time to the event will be key in its success. Introducing tools that the students can use at their current academic level and modeling toward course curriculum.</p>
